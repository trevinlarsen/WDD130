    <h2>Trevin Larsen</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Trevin and I am in the CIT major with an emphasis on Cybersecurity. 
        I love to fly fish, ski as much as I can in the winter, and I love doing anything really outside.
        I just got married this last summer, or I guess I should say this last month!
    </p>
    <p>The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is the fact that classes feel very engaging as they arent anywhere near as big as other universities.
        I hope to get the basics of CSS and HTML out of this class so I can better unbderstand how the web works.
    </p>
