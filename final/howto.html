        <h2>Access Map #1</h2>
        <p>
            Some of the popular access points include Teton River County Park, where you can find well-maintained trails and picnic areas, and Horseshoe Bridge
            , which offers an easily accessible spot for anglers with a scenic view of the river. This first spot is very easy so access and wade in. This would be a perfect spot to teach someone to fish if they havent. On this section of river you will want to use very small
            flies usually size 16 or above. The smaller fly usually the more success you will have.

            The Teton River, known for its world-class fly fishing,
             provides anglers with several accessible points to cast their lines and immerse themselves in its pristine waters. This second spot is for more of an adventure seeking fisherman. Yopu will need a four wheel drive vehicle with high clearance to get down to the river. This is 
             the steepest and fastest flowing section of the teton. Using fast sinking flies and fly line for your streamers is a great option.

            Teton River Canyon provides more adventurous fishing opportunities, accessible through hiking trails or boat launches. This specific spot is accesed from the North side of the river. It is quite the hike down to the water. However you are able to launch a boat here by repelling
             a raft with the anchoring of trees. If you choose this option it can offer some of the best fishing to the least accesed spots on the Teton. Less pressured fish means more in the net. Dry dropper is the way to go most of the year with big stonefly patterns early summer. The second 
             marked spot here is the take-out point at Spring Hollow if you choose to launch a raft here.
