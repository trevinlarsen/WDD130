        The Teton River is a meandering gem of pristine beauty, nestled in the heart of the Rocky Mountains in Idaho. This picturesque river is renowned for its exceptional fly fishing opportunities, drawing anglers from around the world to its clear, cold waters. With its headwaters originating in the towering Teton Range, the river flows through a diverse landscape of alpine meadows, dense forests, and open valleys, creating the perfect habitat for a thriving population of native cutthroat, rainbow, and brook trout. Fly fishing along the Teton River is a true angler's paradise, offering a chance to test one's skills amidst breathtaking natural scenery. The river's challenging currents and abundant insect life make it an ideal destination for fly fishermen seeking an authentic and rewarding experience in the great outdoors.

      <h3>Access Maps</h3>
      <p>
        As the teton starts in the headwaters in Victor Idaho down through the teton dam, there is many accesspoints that offer different parts of fishing. The first access point is Horseshoe Bridge which is a great easy flowing part of the teton. The next access before the narrows is the bridge right under highway-33. After this point comes the old hydro electric plant which is a steep and difficult spot to access. The fourth access point is the 'Bitch Creek Conversion Point'. This is where the teton and the creek combine into the fast flowing waters into the rapid section of the river. From here you can float 6 miles downstream to the Spring Hollow Road takeout. There are a few miles of rapids that flow into the fallen Teton Dam. This access point is paved with gravel and is a great beginner spot to try fishing. The Last and final take out is the Teton Bridge right above the small town of Newdale.
